# ChainLinkerSDK

## Description

A decentralized ledger platform utilizing a novel consensus algorithm combining VRF-based leader election with honeycomb-shaped blockchain architecture, enabling high-throughput and low-latency transactions with adaptive security guarantees.

## Features

- Here are 7 technical features for the ChainLinkerSDK software project:
- "Authenticates API requests using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with RSA256 encryption",
- "Executes smart contract calls using asynchronous, nonblocking I/O operations",
- "Provides realtime data feeds from decentralized oracles using WebSockets",
- "Supports multiparty computation (MPC) for secure, privacypreserving data aggregation",
- "Offers configurable gas management with dynamic fee estimation and optimization",
- "Implements robust error handling with retries and exponential backoff for reliable transaction submission",
- "Includes builtin support for IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized data storage"
- Let me know if you need anything else!
